0,ARIES," Your week falls neatly into distinct phases. The completion of routine tasks is your number one priority until Tuesday and, after Wednesday, you'll deal with all those emotional wobbles. But if someone does seem intent on causing a fuss, why not just ignore them? It would be best if you concentrated on your own affairs. "
1,TAURUS," You're coming to the end of an emotional period, when you've been too ready to sacrifice your interests to those of other people. Your desire to serve others is admirable, but not if it means that partners walk all over you! Your horoscope continues to show an unusual concentration on money and, by all accounts, your business sense is booming. "
2,GEMINI," Passions are still running high, and the degree of emotional intensity circulating in the cosmos remains pretty awe-inspiring. To avoid trouble, you must be impeccably polite and considerate. At work, it is now time to learn a new skill, perhaps by taking a short course. It doesn't have to be a big deal. "
3,CANCER," First things first - don't rush it! There is still a great deal going on behind the scenes, away from prying eyes, and you have to be happy with your plans before you go public. After all, you don't want to risk unnecessary criticism, do you? In love, you're still chasing a fairy-tale fantasy but please keep one foot in the real world. "
4,LEO," The greatest pressures are coming from all directions at once, and midweek - perhaps from Tuesday to Thursday - you'll probably decide that you've had enough. If you feel like ducking out and disappearing for a few days, go right ahead! Do be sure to keep family members informed of what you're doing, though. That's only fair. "
5,VIRGO," Get up with the lark and go to bed with the owl for, while upbeat, energetic Mars is charging through your chart, you will cram as much in to every week as you can. The one golden rule is to pace yourself, eat well and keep fit. A financial deal could finally yield a profit around Thursday or Friday. And, if you have a chance for a rest, take it. "
6,LIBRA," The Sun's marvellous motions mean that it's time for all born under the sign of the Balance to celebrate their blessings and put their burdens into perspective. However, the really good news is provided by Mercury and Venus, two splendid planets which encourage you to take confidence-building measures. Plus, be sure to settle all those issues which are troubling you. "
7,SCORPIO," You have many talents, but you often give out misleading signals. Some people regard your tendency to secrecy as a bad characteristic. How wrong they are! Your ability to respect confidences and reward the trust placed in you is a fine quality which will come in very handy over the next two or three weeks. "
8,SAGITTARIUS," Many of you are still inclined to blow your tops, but you must remember that people you think are guilty are in fact completely innocent! Passions should be running high, but you may direct your energy towards positive, constructive and cultural ways of enjoying yourself. An old friend may have the best advice, so listen well – and take heed. "
9,CAPRICORN," You’re on a positive path – that’s for sure. This is still a relatively busy phase, and by no means dull – if not wildly exciting. If you're alive to new possibilities you'll find all sorts of ways to bring a little inspiration to work and routine chores. Ambitious Capricorns are now moving into top gear - and about time too! "
10,AQUARIUS," You can now look ahead and make plans for the coming months. Right now, some people are unwilling to accept flattery or generous gestures. I hope you're not among them because, over the period ahead, a number of partners, friends and colleagues will be more than willing to offer you praise, affection and presents. "
11,ARIES," You may have a sense of being in limbo, or cast adrift. Quite why this should be so is not clear, but we can say that you'll have your feet back on firm ground very soon. This is a time to be constructive in outlook and resolute and firm in your approach. "
12,TAURUS," Stress levels are set to ease up. A battle royal has been taking place between a number of other planets, an encounter with profound consequences for your emotional security. It may be that you have already decided that things cannot go on as before. But then, you have known that for a long while. Come to think of it, it's time for an improvement! "
13,GEMINI," If you have been in touch with underlying trends, you will know that this has been a time of unique and reassuring experiences. But you must still be aware that there are serious emotional questions to be dealt with. It's just that it's difficult to get to the real issues. "
14,CANCER, Many of you will be feeling the uncompromising impact of Mars blowing through your life. It must be clear by now that the pattern of your affairs and activities must be changed for the better. And I have a feeling you'll make a start by putting up some extra cash. 
15,LEO," Perhaps you now feel like battening down the hatches and taking shelter from emotional assaults. You may feel unfairly squeezed between people who think you should become more deeply involved and those who wish you to withdraw altogether. Watch out for financial confrontations - they can be avoided, you know. "
16,VIRGO," Seven planets encouraging you to do your own thing and go your own way is not bad support. You are under no pressure to take certain adventurous and even extraordinary steps, but the opportunity is there if you wish to use it. It really is up to you. "
17,LIBRA," It is your own sweet nature which enables you to keep your emotions and temper under control. You must continue to exercise charm, tact and diplomacy even if you fear that you have suffered in a business matter. It's time to forgive and forget. "
18,SCORPIO," Accept the fact that partners have their own beliefs, ideas and feelings. You may have cause to take up the gauntlet and rise to the challenge, yet it may be best to let matters rest and go your own way. Partners are likely to be over-fussy, but that's all down to the current awkward lunar alignments. "
19,SAGITTARIUS," Realise that a joint financial arrangement or business association may have to end if you are to achieve a number of goals or ambitions. On the other hand, you must forge a new relationship without delay. Only then will you know that you have the support to proceed. "
20,CAPRICORN," The next few days lift your heart and raise your hopes. When dealing with affairs of the heart you must take into account the fact that partners are now developing much stronger ideas as to who does what and when. It may be tactful to give way, at least in the short-term. "
21,AQUARIUS," You may still need to spend some time away from home or outside your usual environment if you are to be certain of your next move. On the other hand, domestic responsibilities are likely to deny you the chance to get away. But, first, figure out exactly how much your plans will cost. "
22,ARIES," You know full well that it is within your power to determine the outcome of financial negotiations and discussions. There's something that's still not entirely clear, though. Perhaps the role of a female associate has yet to be established - you don't quite know where you stand. "
23,TAURUS, Current astrological trends offer you a marvellous opportunity to face up to awkward or highly emotional situations. Acknowledge partners' complaints and criticism in the knowledge that you have got what it takes to put them right. You must believe in yourself. 
24,GEMINI," You are now entering a phase in which you may reasonably allow situations to take their own course. However, as far as specifically financial affairs are concerned, you must be careful not to let events run out of your control, especially at this delicate stage. "
25,CANCER," You're still on top of events, but your best bet at the moment is to occupy your time in such a manner that you cannot be forced to accept unsatisfactory conditions. Keep a close watch on financial affairs later in the day, and make sure that nobody pulls the wool over your eyes. "
26,LEO," This is likely to be a crucial period as far as both career and domestic hopes are concerned. Family pressures which have surfaced recently may go back a long way. Now you have the opportunity to tackle these entrenched, long-term issues and deal with partners who have dug their heels in. "
27,VIRGO," The current Pluto alignment indicates that an emotional or family tie is quite clearly giving you some cause for concern just now. However, a solution lies well within your grasp and it is therefore in your interests to be placatory; it's easy when you know how! "
28,LIBRA," In a matter of days a number of pieces of the jigsaw will fit into place. Yet first you may have to endure a certain amount of aggravation from partners who still do not believe you are up to the job. It is true, though, that you may have to smarten up your act. "
29,SCORPIO," Mercury's relationship with your sign suggests that you have probably become accustomed to harsh words and heavy demands, especially when discussing personal questions. All the relevant issues must now be brought to the surface. And sooner rather than later. "
30,SAGITTARIUS," There really seems to be little point in arguing or apportioning blame over a career matter. You must see that there is much good sense in what other people have to say, and you will reject good advice at your peril. It's time to listen, and to bide your time. "
31,CAPRICORN," Partners and close associates have really been remarkably willing to compromise when you think about it. You have only a short time left to reach a firm agreement before you again run into stiff opposition. Oh, and keep an eye on legal irritations. "
32,AQUARIUS," Recent statements have undoubtedly been an eye-opener, and you now have the perfect opportunity to pull a number of different emotional strands together. Close friends will appreciate your new, fresh approach. It makes a change from partners complaining that you are upsetting their plans! "
